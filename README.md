# Data Exploration & Visualization

### Importance
Data exploration and visualization are critical for understanding the underlying patterns and structures in the data. They help in identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies that might not be evident from raw data.

### Techniques
- Use of libraries like Pandas for data manipulation.
- Use of Plotly for creating interactive visualizations.

# Data Cleaning

### Importance
Ensures the data is accurate, consistent, and usable. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.

### Techniques
Various methods to deal with data quality issues, ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

# Anomalies Detection and Treatment Techniques

### Importance
Identifying and handling anomalies is crucial to maintain the integrity of the analysis. Anomalies can distort statistical analyses and predictive models.

### Techniques
Different algorithms and methods for detecting outliers and anomalies in the data. This could include statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and domain-specific rules.

# Applied Domains
Anomaly detection and treatment techniques can be applied in a wide range of fields:
- Statistics
